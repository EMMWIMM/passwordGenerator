Generates a random password meeting the specifications the users requests via page prompts.
Effort was taken to ensure:
- if NO character type was agreed to a password could not be generated
- there would be an even distribution of selected character types, but that the remainder was always accounted for
- that "yes" or "no" answer was given for required prompts
- that a digit was given for the password length that was between 8 and 128 <img width="468" alt="howManyCharactersinpasswordPrompt" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105828266/182663734-012a4675-aa05-4e00-8cc2-c79f86d06b7e.png">
